# Question 1: Do Problem 3 in chapter 5 of Gelman and Hill.
You are interested in how well the combined earnings of the parents in a childâ€™s family predicts high school graduation. You are told that the probability a child graduates from high school is 27% for children whose parents earn no income and is 88% for children whose parents earn $60,000. Determine the logistic regression model that is consistent with this information. (For simplicity you may want to assume that income is measured in units of $10,000).


$$logit(0.88) = logit(0.27) + 6*x$$
$$1.99243 = -0.9946226 + 6*x$$
$$x = \frac{1.99243 + 0.9946226}{6} =  0.4978421$$

## Substituiting X we get:
$$P(y=1) = logit^{-1}(-0.9946226 +  0.4978421*x)$$




## We can simulate x1 using our Regression Model:



```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

x1=rnorm(1000000,0,1)
pr1=invlogit(-0.9946226 +  0.4978421*x1)
y1<-rbinom(1000000,1,pr1) 

df <- data.frame(x1=x1,y1=y1)


logit.model <- glm(y1 ~ x1, data=df, family=binomial(link="logit"))
#summary(logit.model)
stargazer(logit.model,
          header=F,
          type = "latex",
          no.space = T,
          summary = F,
          single.row = T
          )

```

# Question 2: Do Problem 5 in chapter 5 of Gelman and Hill.
In a class of 50 students, a logistic regression is performed of course grade (pass or fail) on midterm exam score (continuous values with mean 60 and standard deviation 15). The fitted model is $Pr(pass) = logit^{-1}(-24 + 0.4x)$.




## Part A
Graph the fitted model. Also on this graph put a scatter plot of hypothetical data consistent with the information given.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(654)
x1=rnorm(50,60,15)
pr=invlogit(-24+0.4*x1)
y1<-rbinom(50,1,pr) 
df2 <- data.frame(
  x1=x1,
  y1,y1,
  pr,pr
)
ggplot(data=data.frame(x=c(0,100)), aes(x=x)) + stat_function(fun=function(x) invlogit(-24 + 0.4*x))+geom_point(data=data.frame(x1,y1),aes(x1,y1))+
    theme_classic()+ guides(fill=FALSE)


```

## Part B
Suppose the midterm scores were transformed to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. What would be the equation of the logistic regression using these transformed scores as a predictor?
$$P(pass) = logit^{-1}( \beta_0 + \beta_1x) =>original$$
$$P(pass) = logit^{-1}( \hat{\beta_0} +\hat{\beta_1}\frac{x-\bar{x}}{S_{x} }) =>standardized (x_i)$$



From above we find that:
$$\hat{\beta_1} =\beta_1 * S_{x} = .4*15 =6$$
$$\hat{\beta_0} =\beta_0 + \frac{6*60}{15 } = -24+24 =0$$
Substituting 6 and 0 we get:
$$P(pass) = logit^{-1}(0 + 6x )$$


```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data=data.frame(x=c(-4,4)), aes(x=x)) + stat_function(fun=function(x) invlogit(0 + 6*x))+theme_classic()+ guides(fill=FALSE)


```

\onecolumn

## Part C

Create a new predictor that is pure noise (for example, in R you can create `newpred <- rnorm(n,0,1)`). Add it to your model. How much does the deviance decrease?

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(555)
randomNoise <- rnorm(50,0,1) # noide

x1=rnorm(50,0,1)
pr1=invlogit(6*x1)
y1<-rbinom(50,1,pr1) 

df3 <- data.frame(x1=x1,y1=y1)


logit.model <- glm(y1 ~ x1, data=df3, family=binomial(link="logit"))
logit.model2 <- glm(y1 ~ x1+randomNoise, data=df3, family=binomial(link="logit"))

texreg(list(logit.model, logit.model2), single.row=TRUE,  float.pos = "h")



```

If we add a predictor that is pure noise deviance barely decreases. It only decreases by 0.006 i.e from 25.064 to 25.058

# Question 3: Do Problem 8 in chapter 5 of Gelman and Hill. 

Building a logistic regression model: the folder `rodents` contains data on rodents in a sample of New York City apartments.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

rodents.df <- read.table("data/rodents.txt")
rodents.df$race <- factor(rodents.df$race, 
                          labels=c("White",
                                   "Black", 
                                   "Puerto Rican",

# Missing values
missingNA <- sapply(rodents.df, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
rodents.df <- na.omit(rodents.df)


```

## Part A

Build a logistic regression model to predict the presence of rodents (the variable `rodent2` in the dataset) given indicators for the ethnic groups (race). Combine categories as appropriate. Discuss the estimated coefficients in the model.



```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

rodents.logit1 <- glm(rodent2 ~ race, data=rodents.df, family=binomial(link="logit"))
#summary(rodents.logit1)
texreg(list(rodents.logit1), single.row=TRUE,  float.pos = "h")


```



We find that:

* `White Race (Intercept)`: The odds of having rodents infestation in an apartment primarily occupied by White people is $\exp(-1.70) =  0.18$. In other words, an apartment occupied by white people has a $logit^{-1}(-1.70) = 0.1539 = 15.39\%$ probability of having rodents infestation

* `Black Race`: 
 The odds of having rodents infestation in an apartment primarily occupied by black people is $\exp(1.312) = 3.71$ times the odds of having  rodents infestation in an apartment occupied by white people.  In other words, apartment occupied by black people was 3.71 times more likely to be infested by rodents compared to apartment occupied by white.
 
 * `Puerto Rican Race`: 
 The odds of having rodents infestation in an apartment primarily occupied by Puerto Rican people is $\exp(1.312) =  3.1428571$ times the odds of having  rodents infestation in an apartment occupied by white people.
 
  * `Other Hispanic Race`: 
 The odds of having rodents infestation in an apartment primarily occupied by Puerto Rican people is $\exp(1.4624) =  4.3164557$ times the odds of having  rodents infestation in an apartment occupied by white people.
 
 * `Amer-Indian/Native Alaska`:
 The odds of having rodents infestation in an apartment primarily occupied by Amer-Indian/Native Alaska people is $\exp(2.1102) = 8.25$ times the odds of having  rodents infestation in an apartment occupied by white people.
 
 
 The other races like Asian/Pacific Islander  were insignificant implying that the odds of rodents infestation were not different from the comparison group (white race).

   

In summary, Hispanic and black presence in an apartment are positively associated with rodents infestation.

##  Part B

### Add to your model some other potentially relevant predictors describing the apartment, building, and community district. Build your model using the general principles explained in Section 4.6. Discuss the coefficients for the ethnicity indicators in your model.

We performed stepwise AIC regression selection before assessing these predictors using guidelines highlighted in section 4.6. After ensuring that all sign of predictors and significance of predictors were OK, we went ahead and assessed effect modifiers (interactions). Interactions between race and Hispanic, and race and black presence were statistically insignificant. Putting all these factors into consideration We ended up creating a model shown below:


```{r include=FALSE}
rodents.df$rodent2 <- as.factor(rodents.df$rodent2)
#rodents.df$hispanic_Mean10 <- rodents.df$hispanic_Mean * 10
#rodents.df$black_Mean10 <- rodents.df$black_Mean * 10
#rodents.logit2 <- glm(rodent2 ~ race + hispanic_Mean10 + black_Mean10 + borough + old + housing + personrm + struct + foreign, data=rodents.df, family=binomial(link="logit"))

rodentLogitModel.all <- glm(formula=rodent2~.-sequenceno-cd, family=binomial(link="logit"),data=rodents.df)

#summary(rodentLogitModel.all)
rodentLogitModel.all.stepAIC  <- stepAIC(rodentLogitModel.all, direction="both")	
#rodentLogitModel.all.stepAIC$anova

rodents.logit2 <- glm( rodent2 ~ personrm + unitflr2 + regext +
povertyx2 + extflr5_2 + intcrack2 + inthole2 + intleak2 +
struct + help + black_Mean + board2_Mean + help_Mean + hispanic_Mean +
 old_Mean + poverty_Mean + regext_Mean + extwin4_2_Mean +
intcrack2_Mean + inthole2_Mean + vacrate, data=rodents.df, family=binomial(link="logit"))


```

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

texreg(list(rodents.logit2), single.row=TRUE,  float.pos = "h")

```


## Make sure to carefully explain what your final model means.

In general:

* `black_Mean`: Holding the other predictors constant at the base level or 0, a 1% increase in black people in the district changes the odds of rodents infestation by 9.41. Intuitively, holding the other predictors constant at the mean level, a 1% increase in black occupants in the district increases the estimated probability of rodents infestation by (0.904019/4)*100 = 22.6%
* `hispanic_Mean`: Holding the other predictors constant, a 1% increase in Hispanic people in the district changes the odds of rodents infestation in an apartment by 11.85. In other words, holding the other predictors constant at the mean level, a 1% increase in Hispanic occupants in the district increases the estimated probability of rodents infestation by (2.4727/4)*100 = 23.1%
* `race`: Given the fact that the householder race was statistically insignificant, we did not include it in our model. Also the effect of this predictor on the response was not substantial. Contextually, householder race doesn't really matter, the proportion of race around you is much more relevant. 


In summary, black and Hispanic population in that district were associated with higher chances of rodents infestation with Hispanic population leading.



## Check its fit using diagnostics. Make an ROC plot and a calibration curve.

### ROC


```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


plot(Roc(list("Model 1"=rodents.logit1,"Model 2"=rodents.logit2)),legend=TRUE,auc=TRUE)


```

The curve rises steeply indicating that the % of true positives accurately predicted by this logit model rose faster than the false positive.In fact we have a good acceptable AUC of about 82.7%.

### Calibration Curve

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#Concordance(rodents.df$rodent2, predict(rodents.logit2,type="response"))

lgfit <- lrm( rodent2 ~personrm + unitflr2 + regext +
povertyx2 + extflr5_2 + intcrack2 + inthole2 + intleak2 +
struct + help + black_Mean + board2_Mean + help_Mean + hispanic_Mean +
 old_Mean + poverty_Mean + regext_Mean + extwin4_2_Mean +
intcrack2_Mean + inthole2_Mean + vacrate, data=rodents.df, x=TRUE, y=TRUE)



# exp(final.fit$coefficients)
plot(calibrate(lgfit), main="Calibration Curve")


```

In general, the calibration plot did not provide substantial evidence that our models was overfitted. However, the calibration plot depicted that the model had  little evidence of underestimation of high probabilities.

### Confusion Matrix
From the confusion matrix below we have a good truth detection rate i.e few false positive and few false negative
```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
threshold=0.5
predicted_values<-ifelse(predict(rodents.logit2,rodents.df,type="response")>threshold,1,0)
actual_values<-rodents.df$rodent2
conf_matrix<-table(predicted_values,actual_values)
conf_matrix


#Sensitivity(actual_values,predicted_values,threshold)
#Specificity(actual_values,predicted_values,threshold)


```


### Multicollinearity Diagnosis
Most of the predictors in the mode had Variable Inflation Factor of less than 2. intcrack and inhole indicated elevated level of VIF implying presence of collinearity.  This was not alarming because we are building a predictive model.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

vif(rodents.logit2)

```

# Question 4: The full dehydration outcome for the Dhaka study that we looked at in class is a three-level variable (none, some or severe). Build two proportional odds regression models for this three-level variable. In the first use the clinical signs only. In the second, add in the additional predictors. Keep variables that you feel are important to prediction and to interpretation. Interpret your results clearly.

### Model with all Clinical Variables: 

We treated the following variables as clinical predictor variables.
  - genapp
  - tears
  - skin
  - resp
  - thirst
  - eyes
  - heart
  - mucous
  - pulse 
  - urine

We then went ahead and threw all these variables into the model.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dhaka=read.csv("data/dhaka.csv")
dhaka$dehyd = factor(dhaka$dehyd)
dhaka$genapp = factor(dhaka$genapp)
dhaka$tears = factor(dhaka$tears)
dhaka$skin = factor(dhaka$skin)
dhaka$resp = factor(dhaka$resp)
dhaka$thirst = factor(dhaka$thirst)
dhaka$eyes = factor(dhaka$eyes)
dhaka$capref=factor(dhaka$capref)
dhaka$extrem=factor(dhaka$extrem)
dhaka$heart=factor(dhaka$heart)
dhaka$mucous=factor(dhaka$mucous)
dhaka$pulse=factor(dhaka$pulse)
dhaka$urine=factor(dhaka$urine)


dhaka.clinical.model<- vglm(ordered(dehyd) ~ genapp+tears+skin+resp+thirst+eyes+heart+mucous+pulse+urine ,family=cumulative(parallel=TRUE),data=dhaka)



```

```
Call:

    data = dhaka)

```

From this model, we observed that mucous, muac, thirst and urine were statistically insignificant therefore we removed them from our final model.

### Best Model with both clinical and non clinical variables: 

We then went ahead and created a correlation matrix in order to assess correlation in potential predictors.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}


corr.panel <- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix="", cex.cor) 
{
    usr <- par("usr"); on.exit(par(usr)) 
    par(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1)) 
    r <- abs(cor(x, y)) 
    txt <- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1] 
    txt <- paste(prefix, txt, sep="") 
    if(missing(cex.cor)) cex <- 0.8/strwidth(txt) 
 
    test <- cor.test(x,y) 
    # borrowed from printCoefmat
    Signif <- symnum(test$p.value, corr = FALSE, na = FALSE, 
                  cutpoints = c(0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1),
                  symbols = c("***", "**", "*", ".", " ")) 
 
    text(0.3, 0.3, txt, cex = 1) 
    text(.6, .6, Signif, cex=1, col=2) 
}

  
    

pairs(dhaka[c(1,3:6,8:10,12,16:18)], lower.panel=corr.panel, upper.panel=corr.panel)


```
 
 - 3 non clinical predictors had significant correlation with the response, therefore we included it in our final model. The correlation matrix also established that most of the clinical predictors included in the previous model had significant and strong correlation. 
 
- We also checked for interaction between several covariates but none were significant. Potential covariates we assessed for interactions included: tears and eyes, thirst and urine, heart and pulse, daysOfDia and skin 
 
- After checking for interactions we came up  with our final model shown below:

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#none some server
dhaka.best.model<- vglm(ordered(dehyd)~genapp+resp+skin+eyes+ pulse+daysofdiar+episodes, family=cumulative(parallel=TRUE),data=dhaka)

#summary(dhaka.best.model)


```

### Interpretation

- In general only 4 predictors were statistically significant: genapp, skin, eyes, episodes

* `genapp`:
General appearance  has 3 level: Normal (0), Restless/Irritable (1), Lethargic/Unconscious (2). Normal is the reference in this model.
    - `genapp1` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                   "Restless/Irritable" general appearance  is 0.5399427 times the odds of having no dehydration in children            with "normal" general appearance.
    - `genapp2` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                    "Lethargic/Unconscious" general appearance  is 0.2624490 times the odds of having no dehydration in children         with "normal" general appearance.

* `skin`:
Skin  has 3 level: Normal Skin Pinch (0), Slow Skin Pinch (1), Very Slow Skin Pinch (2). Normal is the reference in this model.
    - `skin1` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                   "slow" skin pinch is 0.4272413 times the odds of having no dehydration in children with "normal" skin pinch.
    - `skin2` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                    "very slow" skin pinch is 0.4339146 times the odds of having no dehydration in children with "normal" skin          pinch.


* `eyes`:
Eyes has 3 level: Normal (0), Sunken (1), Very Sunken (2). Normal is the reference in this model.
    - `eyes1` "Sunken" eyes was statistically insignificant.
    - `eyes2` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehidration in children with                    "Very Sunken" eyes is 0.3023435 times the odds of having no dehydration in children with "normal" eyes.

#' # Question 1: Do Problem 3 in chapter 5 of Gelman and Hill.	
#' You are interested in how well the combined earnings of the parents in a childâ€™s family predicts high school graduation. You are told that the probability a child graduates from high school is 27% for children whose parents earn no income and is 88% for children whose parents earn $60,000. Determine the logistic regression model that is consistent with this information. (For simplicity you may want to assume that income is measured in units of $10,000).	
#' 	
#' 	
#' $$logit(0.88) = logit(0.27) + 6*x$$	
#' $$1.99243 = -0.9946226 + 6*x$$	
#' $$x = \frac{1.99243 + 0.9946226}{6} =  0.4978421$$	
#'

#' # Question 2: Do Problem 5 in chapter 5 of Gelman and Hill.	
#' In a class of 50 students, a logistic regression is performed of course grade (pass or fail) on midterm exam score (continuous values with mean 60 and standard deviation 15). The fitted model is $Pr(pass) = logit^{-1}(-24 + 0.4x)$.	
#'

#' Suppose the midterm scores were transformed to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. What would be the equation of the logistic regression using these transformed scores as a predictor?

#'  The odds of having rodents infestation in an apartment primarily occupied by black people is $\exp(1.312) = 3.71$ times the odds of having  rodents infestation in an apartment occupied by white people.

#'  	
#'  * `Puerto Rican Race`: 	
#'  The odds of having rodents infestation in an apartment primarily occupied by Puerto Rican people is $\exp(1.312) =  3.1428571$ times the odds of having  rodents infestation in an apartment occupied by white people.

#'

#'  The other races like Asian/Pacific Islander  were insignificant implying that the odds of rodents infestation were not different from the comparison group (white race).

#' We performed stepwise AIC regression selection before assessing these predictors using guidelines highlighted in section 4.6. After ensuring that all sign of predictors and significance of predictors were OK, we went ahead and assessed effect modifiers (interactions). Interactions between race and Hispanic, and race and black presence were statistically insignificant. Putting all these factors into consideration We ended up creating a model shown below:

#' ## Make sure to carefully explain what your final model means.	
#' 	
#' In general:	
#' 	
#' * `black_Mean`: Holding the other predictors constant at the base level or 0, a 1% increase in black people in the district changes the odds of rodents infestation by 9.41. Intuitively, holding the other predictors constant at the mean level, a 1% increase in black occupants in the district increases the estimated probability of rodents infestation by (0.904019/4)*100 = 22.6%	
#' * `hispanic_Mean`: Holding the other predictors constant, a 1% increase in Hispanic people in the district changes the odds of rodents infestation in an apartment by 11.85. In other words, holding the other predictors constant at the mean level, a 1% increase in Hispanic occupants in the district increases the estimated probability of rodents infestation by (2.4727/4)*100 = 23.1%	
#' * `race`: Given the fact that the householder race was statistically insignificant, we did not include it in our model. Also the effect of this predictor on the response was not substantial. Contextually, householder race doesn't really matter, the proportion of race around you is much more relevant. 	
#' 	
#' 	
#' In summary, black and Hispanic population in that district were associated with higher chances of rodents infestation with Hispanic population leading.

#'  - 3 non clinical predictors had significant correlation with the response, therefore we included it in our final model. The correlation matrix also established that most of the clinical predictors included in the previous model had significant and strong correlation. 	
#'  	
#' - We also checked for interaction between several covariates but none were significant. Potential covariates we assessed for interactions included: tears and eyes, thirst and urine, heart and pulse, daysOfDia and skin 	
#'  	
#' - After checking for interactions we came up  with our final model shown below:

#' ### Interpretation	
#' 	
#' - In general only 4 predictors were statistically significant: genapp, skin, eyes, episodes	
#' 	
#' * `genapp`:	
#' General appearance  has 3 level: Normal (0), Restless/Irritable (1), Lethargic/Unconscious (2). Normal is the reference in this model.	
#'     - `genapp1` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                   "Restless/Irritable" general appearance  is 0.5399427 times the odds of having no dehydration in children            with "normal" general appearance.	
#'     - `genapp2` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                    "Lethargic/Unconscious" general appearance  is 0.2624490 times the odds of having no dehydration in children         with "normal" general appearance.	
#' 	
#' * `skin`:	
#' Skin  has 3 level: Normal Skin Pinch (0), Slow Skin Pinch (1), Very Slow Skin Pinch (2). Normal is the reference in this model.	
#'     - `skin1` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                   "slow" skin pinch is 0.4272413 times the odds of having no dehydration in children with "normal" skin pinch.	
#'     - `skin2` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehydration in children with                    "very slow" skin pinch is 0.4339146 times the odds of having no dehydration in children with "normal" skin          pinch.	
#' 	
#' 	
#' * `eyes`:	
#' Eyes has 3 level: Normal (0), Sunken (1), Very Sunken (2). Normal is the reference in this model.	
#'     - `eyes1` "Sunken" eyes was statistically insignificant.	
#'     - `eyes2` Holding the other predictor constant, the odds of having no dehidration in children with                    "Very Sunken" eyes is 0.3023435 times the odds of having no dehydration in children with "normal" eyes.
